Hi, I’m Ohmri — a data scientist with background in analytical chemistry and a passion for Data-Science

I specialize in building data pipelines, predictive models, and automation tools using Python, R, SQL, and Power BI. My work often involves analyzing complex datasets from scientific instruments and educational environments, with a focus on explainable machine learning and actionable insights.

I’m committed to creating interpretable models and clear visualizations that help non-technical stakeholders understand and trust data-driven decisions. Whether it’s predicting student retention or processing spectral data, I prioritize transparency and collaboration.

I’m always open to feedback, collaboration, or new opportunities. email: enquiries@ohmri.com
